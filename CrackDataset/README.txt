This folder contains: 
- IMAGES: The original images that contains 5 sub-folders with the images obtained with the 5 different sensors. 
    The names of the images follow this pattern: Im_[GT|noGT]_<Name of the sensor>_<number of the image>.<format>. 
    - GT/noGT means with Ground Truth/without Ground Truth. 
    - The name of the 5 sensors are: AIGLE_RN, ESAR, LCMS, LRIS, TEMPEST2. 
- GROUNDTRUTH: The ground truth of some of the images of IMAGES (whose named ***_GT_***) per sensors (so, again, 5 sub-folders). 
    The names of the ground truth follow this pattern: GT_<Name of the sensor>_<number of the image>.<format>. 
    The names of the 5 sensors are still the same. 
- RESULTS: It contains all the results obtained for each image (with and wihtout ground truth), for all the approaches tested. 
    So, it also contains 5 sub-folders. 
    The names of the results follow this pattern: Res_[GT/noGT]_<Name of the sensor>_<number of the image>_<name of the method>.<format>
    GT/noGT means the same as for original images. 
    Name of the sensor are still the same. 
    Name of the method are :
    - GC for Geodesic Contours based on Points Of Interest detection [Chambon2011a]
    - M1 and M2 for the Markovian Modelling and Adaptive Filtering approaches [Chambon2011b]
    - MPS for the Minimal Path Selection method [Amhaz 2016] 
    - NGU for Free Form Anisotropy [Nguyen 2011]
- AmhazChambon_TITS_2016.pdf: the draft version of the paper related to this dataset.
